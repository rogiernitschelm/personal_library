# Introduction

This is my Neighborhood Map project. I decided to turn it into an app
covering some magnificent places in France. Exclusively places with
a considerate historical value.

My choice for France was made because of the recently released TV-show
Versailles and some other shows that cover parts of French history.

# How to use

Simply open index.html.

# Additional information

Since there are quite some monuments present, I added symbols
representing the era in French history. 

1. The traditional French flag (Republic)
2. The royal French flag (Bourbon-dynasty)
3. Imperial flag (Bonaparte)
4. Old French flag (Anything else)
