# TDD with Rails RSpec

## Intro

This is a rails-project made to show testing specs with RSpec. The main focus thus, was creating specs and making them succeed by writing correct actions and so on.

Eventually I want to store tutorials and functional summaries here. So I can quickly look up my past code.
