# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
A few hours. But most of the time I was figuring out the obstacles I faced.
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
Figuring out how to ensure false priority levels could be catched. It was harder
than I expected, so I had to do some research.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I build two features to change or display info about the priority. Some things
might need a higher priority. And sometimes you have to check if a priority is
yet present.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I think I made some progress yet but I need to practise the more advanced features.
